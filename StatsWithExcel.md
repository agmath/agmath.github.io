title: Applied Statistics
description: This is a homepage for MAT240, Applied Statistics, with Dr. Gilbert at Southern New Hampshire University. This course covers an introduction to data, exploratory data analyses and data visualization, one- and two-sample inference via confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for both proportions and means, chi-squared tests for goodness of fit and independence, ANOVA for comparisons of multiple group means, and introduces linear regression. The course also provides an introduction to Excel, the use of which is embedded throughout the semester.

***Course Description:*** This is a fundamental course in the application of statistics.  In this course, students learn how to apply statistical techniques to a variety of applications in business and the social sciences.  Students learn how to solve statistical problems by hand and through the use of computer software.  Topics include probability distribution functions, sampling distributions, estimation, hypothesis testing, and linear regression.
