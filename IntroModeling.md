***Course Description:*** Mathematical modeling is used for everything from tracking the spread of diseases 
and predicting the weather to making suggestions for your next Amazon purchase. So, what is Mathematical 
modeling? Mathematical modeling is the process of creating simplified representations of often complex 
real-world phenomena that helps us more easily understand and analyze these complex systems. In this course, 
students will learn about basic modeling principles and methods using real-world examples from biology, 
Earth sciences, social sciences, engineering, and/or business.<br/>
