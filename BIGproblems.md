title: BIG Problems
description: This is a homepage for MAT440, BIG Problems, with Dr. Gilbert at Southern New Hampshire University. In this course, student teams collaborate with a partner from Business, Industry, or Government (BIG) to tackle real-world problems whose solutions can make a meaningful impact for the partnering entity.

      <p style="margin: 0;"><strong>Course Description:</strong> BIG Problems in Mathematics will engage students with research problems in the areas of Business, Industry, and Government (BIG) agencies. Through the course of the semester, students will work toward a solution to a single or series of problems posed by BIG liaisons, concluding with a final written report and video presentation to the sponsoring agency. Specific course topics will change depending on the needs of the sponsoring agency.</p>

<p> <strong>More About MAT440 (BIG Problems):</strong> MAT440 is one of several courses that satisfies the Culmination requirement in the Commons/General Education program at Southern New Hampshire University.
</p>

<p> BIG Problems is a project-driven course where teams of students act as consultants for a partnering organization. Partners may include non-profits, government agencies, municipalities, or companies. Each partner donates a problem that they either lack the internal resources or the expertise to solve — but solving it would make a real difference.
</p>

<p>Student teams meet every two to three weeks with a liaison from the partnering agency to report on their progress. In these meetings, teams:

+ Receive feedback on their approaches
+ Learn to adjust and refine their methods
+ Practice translating technical results into language that business and policy leaders can act on

Between meetings, teams iterate, implement feedback, and push their solutions forward.
</p>

<p> <strong>Past projects have included:</strong>
  
  + Modeling dermal (skin) absorption of bromochloromethane, a harmful chemical which is present in some water supplies (partner: U.S. EPA).
  + Modeling tumor growth (partner: DEKA Research and Development).
  + Optimizing manufacturing processes under the threat of rolling blackouts (partner: Procter and Gamble).
  + Developing optimal wide-area search strategies for UAVs and drones (partner: BAE Systems)
</p>

<p> <strong>Who Should Take MAT440?</strong> Any student interested in technical problem solving and communication! </p>

<p> While BIG Problems is listed as a 400-level mathematics course, you don’t need years of math coursework to succeed. In fact, most of the mathematics needed for approaching a BIG Problem will be learned along the way — not drawn from prior courses.

  + <strong>Recommended prerequisite:</strong> any 300-level (or higher) mathematics course, but may be waived after a meeting with the instructor.
  + <strong>Open to all majors and modalities.</strong> Students from both on-campus and online programs at SNHU are welcome. BIG Problems teams benefit from diverse backgrounds and experiences.

<p> <strong>Transferable Skills You'll Build in MAT440:</strong> Students gain more than knowledge in their specific project domain. By the end of the course, you will have developed skills that transfer directly to careers and graduate study, including:

+ <strong>Research & problem solving:</strong> Tackling open-ended problems with no unique solution
+ <strong>Assumption-making & justification:</strong> Scoping large, complex problems responsibly
+ <strong>Transparency & reproducibility:</strong> Building solutions and reports that others can verify and build upon
+ <strong>Teamwork:</strong> Collaborating across disciplines, and sometimes across geographic distance (with both campus and online peers)
+ <strong>Computing skills:</strong> Using programming languages, simulations, and even working on multi-language teams
+ <strong>Version control (Git/GitHub):</strong> Collaborating, documenting workflows, and tracking progress like professionals do
+ <strong>Professional communication:</strong> Delivering polished written reports and compelling oral presentations to real-world business and government partners

### Course Timeline

This is a project-driven course, so the schedule beyond the first few weeks will be shaped by your team's progress, liaison feedback, and research directions. Here's a tentative outline of the early sessions to get you started.

| Class Meeting | Before Class | During Class | After Class |
|---------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|
| 1 | Review syllabus <br/> Create a GitHub account | Course overview <br/> Meet your team and liaison <br/> Discuss project background | Set up your software environment <br/> (git, Python/R/Matlab, IDE of choice) |
| 2 | Research project and approach | [Crash course in git/GitHub](https://agmath.github.io/intro_git/intro_git_slides.html) | Create a **private** team repo <br/> Add teammates (and me!) <br/> Write a basic README <br/> Create a Quarto project notebook |
| 3 | Continue project and approach research | General software workflow basics <br/> Soft launch...issues, branches, merging | Assign basic initial issues <br/> branch and close with merges |
| 4 | Update project progress | Research strategies: where to look, <br/> how/when to use AI tools, <br/> and how/when not to | Start working! |
| 5+ | Plan for class check-ins <br/> Prepare for interim presentations | Working sessions <br/> Present to liaison ~every 3 weeks | Use feedback to prioritize next steps |
