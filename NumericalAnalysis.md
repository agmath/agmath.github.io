<br/>
***Course Description:*** This course introduces basic techniques for the efficient numerical solution
of problems in engineering, mathematics, and science. Topics covered may include: root finding
methods, interpolation, numerical differentiation and integration, numerical solutions of differential
equations, and matrix theory concepts such as QR factorization and singular value decompositions.
Students will utilize industry-standard software for simulations.<br/>

### Course Timeline and Notebooks

Below is a tentative timeline for our course. It includes preparatory work that should be done prior to each 
class meeting, a detailed set of notes corresponding to each class meeting, and assignments following each 
class meeting.
