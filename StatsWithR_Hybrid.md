title: Modern Statistics With Software (Hybrid)
description: This is a homepage for a Hybrid version of MAT241, Modern Statistics with Software, with Dr. Gilbert at Southern New Hampshire University. This course covers an introduction to data, exploratory data analyses and data visualization, one- and two-sample inference via confidence intervals and hypothesis testing for both proportions and means, chi-squared tests for goodness of fit and independence, ANOVA for comparisons of multiple group means, and introduces linear regression. The course also provides and introduction to R, the use of which is embedded throughout the semester.

## MAT 241 - Modern Statistics with Software (R), Hybrid

<img src="/SiteFiles/OIstats.jpg" align="left" width=200>[**Syllabus (Fall 2025)**](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SkveMsE2guFiQBw0ZmHnXmkggRHHsvXE/view?usp=sharing)<br/>
<br/>
***Course Description:*** This is a fundamental course in modern-day data, data visualization, and the application of statistical techniques to analyze and make inferences from sample data. In a world where data is being constantly collected, it is necessary for individuals to be data literate, to have exposure to the power of data, and to understand as well as practice proper and ethical analyses with data. In a world where data has become abundant, rather than scarce, statistical tools are evolving. This course looks at modern statistical techniques in the age of "Big-Data".<br/>
<br/>
**Software Use:** Students in this course should expect to use R and RStudio locally. I've written [setup 
instructions](https://agmath.github.io/IntroductoryStatistics/AccessingInteractiveNotes.html) 
for all required software and packages for this course. If you are a student planning to complete 
this course with a Chromebook or tablet, then you may create a [Posit Cloud](https://posit.cloud) 
account and copy [this pre-built Posit Cloud Workspace](https://posit.cloud/content/7284986) to 
utilize R and RStudio from a web-browser.<br/>
<br/>
Still not quite sure what to expect? Check out [this in-browser version of the Day 1 Material](https://agmath.github.io/WebRtutorials/MAT241_Intro.html) <br/>
<br/>
***Note on Hybrid Structure*:** This section of Modern Statistics with Software is running in a hybrid
environment. That means that the class physically meets only once per week. Students will be expected 
to do the vast majority of learning and work outside of class meetings.
