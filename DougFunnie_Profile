### About Me

### Coursework I've Completed

Below are descriptions of some particularly interesting courses I've completed.

+ **MAT434 (Statistical Learning and Classification)** - In this course I was focused on actively building and assessing classification models. I used R and Python to build binary and multiclass classifiers. I used techniques from Natural Language Processing to extract meaningful features from text data. I also built deep learning networks for classification.

### Sample Projects

Below are descriptions and links to two projects that I've completed. They're good examples of my work and capabilities so far.

+ **Project A:**
