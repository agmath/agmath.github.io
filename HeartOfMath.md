title: The Heart of Mathematics
description: Wanted! Curious sailers; no prior mathematical experience needed. <br/> <br/> Join me, Dr. Gilbert, as we embark on an ongoing exploration of the continents of mathematics. Some are well known, like the Land of Symmetry or the Sea of Probability; others, like the Mountains of Infinity or the Fractal and Chaos Coasts, reveal their secrets only to the patient traveler. We may even visit the Badlands, where mathematics is bent to questionable ends. Each term, we set our compass toward a different region, studying its landscapes, patterns, and hidden paths. Over time, our collective journeys fill in more of the great mathematical map.

## MAT 135 - The Heart of Mathematics

<img src="/SiteFiles/HeartOfMathMap.png" align="left" width=200>**[[Tentative] Syllabus (Fall 2025)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kqFsdMCM04fz3_ajk49Sq1CmEi1m67B5/view?usp=sharing)**<br/>
<br/>
***Course Description:*** The Heart of Mathematics considers the history, mathematical beauty, and real world applications of a wide variety of topics.  This discussion-based course encourages "out-of-the-box" thinking to explore the connections between mathematics and the world around us.  Topics may include: patterns in nature, infinity, topology, geometry, networking, fractals, and chaos theory, among others.<br/>
