title: Precalculus with Limits
description: This is a homepage for MAT142, Precalculus with Limits, with Dr. Gilbert at Southern New Hampshire University. 
This is a first-year course designed to prepare students for future coursework in calculus. Themes running throughout the 
course are (i) building a strong foundation in algebra, (ii) developing and executing strategies for solving equations, 
(iii) building confidence in evaluating and graphing functions, (iv) understanding equations geometrically as questions 
about intersections of functions or root-finding questions, (v) developing and using the notion of the limit as an extension 
of function evaluation.

<br/>
***Course Description:*** This course emphasizes the numerical, symbolic, and graphical representation of functions needed in 
more advanced mathematics. Students will solve problems and explore the properties of polynomial, rational, trigonometric, 
exponential, and logarithmic functions. Students will also learn to solve a variety of real-world problems using different 
problem-solving strategies. This course includes the study of limits and continuity and is intended for those students who 
wish to prepare for Calculus.
