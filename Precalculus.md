title: Precalculus with Limits
description: This is a homepage for MAT142, Precalculus with Limits, with Dr. Gilbert at Southern New Hampshire University. This is a first-year course, designed to prepare students for future coursework in calculus. Themes running throughout the course include functions, graphs, landmarks of functions (roots, intercepts, discontinuities, etc.), and solutions of equations. A variety of function classes are considered, including linear, quadratic, general polynomial, rational, radical, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric.

***Course Description:*** This course emphasizes the numerical, symbolic, and graphical representation of functions needed in 
more advanced mathematics. Students will solve problems and explore the properties of polynomial, rational, trigonometric, 
exponential, and logarithmic functions. Students will also learn to solve a variety of real-world problems using different 
problem-solving strategies. This course includes the study of limits and continuity and is intended for those students who 
wish to prepare for Calculus.
