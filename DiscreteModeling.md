***Course Description:*** This course is an introduction to discrete mathematical modeling, with applications in 
areas including biology, ecology, epidemiology, and more. Students will be engage with discrete mathematical 
modeling in a variety of context and will use Python (`numpy`, `scipy`, `simpy`, etc) for simulation and analysis. 
Furthermore, students will use the Jupyter Notebook environment to write technical reports.<br/>
<br/>
*Students in this course should expect to be engaged in discrete mathematical modeling applications throughout the
entire semester. Students will work through modeling applications which apply difference equations, discrete 
dynamical systems, agent-based models and simulation, graph-theoretic models, and more. Beyond mathematics, 
students will develop skills in technical reporting. In fact, report-writing is a major component of this 
course.*<br/>
