title: Calculus I
description: This is a homepage for MAT225, Calculus I, with Dr. Gilbert at Southern New Hampshire University. This is a first-year course in single-variable calculus, an introduction to the mathematical study of *change*. Topics covered include limits, derivatives and their applications, and an introduction to antiderivatives and integration. This course serves a variety of students, including students majoring in engineering, the sciences, computer science, game design and programming, mathematics, as well as those with a general interest in mathematics and calculus.

***Course Description:*** Calculus is the mathematical study of change that has widespread applications in science, engineering, economics and business. This course provides a rigorous introduction to singlevariable calculus. Topics include limits, continuity, differentiation and integration of algebraic, trigonometric, exponential, and logarithmic functions, applications of derivatives, and integration, including the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. This course will encourage students to think beyond memorizing formulas and to work towards understanding concepts.<br/>
