<br/><br/>

Hello, and welcome to my webpage! I am a former Associate Professor of Mathematics at Southern New Hampshire University. While I earned my PhD in *Mathematics* under [Dr. Nancy Eaton](http://www.math.uri.edu/~eaton/) at the University of Rhode Island in 2013, my teaching responsibilities and interests have transitioned to data science over the past five years. In particular, I am interested in data science projects that promote the *social good*. The pages on this site contain information about the courses I teach, my current interests/endeavors, and information for people (particularly students) who are interested in working with me. I hope you'll find something useful during your visit!<br/>
(**Page Quick-Links:** [Current Courses](#currently-teaching), [Previous Courses](#course-information-from-previous-semesters), [Undergraduate Research](#research-with-undergraduates), [DS/ML](#data-science-and-machine-learning), [Miscellaneous](#other-initiatives)), 
  

### Currently Teaching

+ [MAT 239 (Discrete Mathematics for Computing)](DiscreteForComputing.md)
+ [MAT 241 (Modern Statistics with Software)](StatsWithR.md)
+ [QSO 370/570 (Predictive Analytics)](PredictiveAnalytics.md)


### Course Information from Previous Semesters

You can find information about courses I've taught in previous semesters [here](OldCourses.md).

### Research With Undergraduates

Are you a current SNHU student who is interested in pursuing an undergraduate research project?I'm really interested in projects involving data science and machine learning, simulation and agent-based modeling, mathematical models, and anything involving graph theory or combinatiorial games. Check out [this page](UGRmentor.md) for more on my interests, recent projects with students, and how to contact me if you are interested in working together.

### Data Science and Machine Learning

I became interested in data science in 2016 and have (slowly) been transitioning my professional focus in this direction ever since. While I'm not much of a blogger, you'll eventually be able to check in on what I'm up to [here](MyDSjourney.md).

### Other Initiatives

In addition to teaching undergraduate and graduate students at Southern New Hampshire University, I have pursued various external projects.

#### Faculty Upskilling Workshops

I have run several summer *Faculty Upskilling* workshops here at SNHU. These workshops are targeted at faculty from a variety of disciplines, spanning the humanities through the sciences. The two workshops I have run are below (links to the 2020 ML Workshop materials will be added at a later date).  
+  Introductory and Intermediate Data Science / Machine Learning (2020) 
+  [Foundations of Natural Language Processing](https://agmath.github.io/FacultyUpskilling/) (2021, with William Jamieson)

#### Open Educational Resources (OER)

I am very passionate about high-quality open educational resources (OER). I have been working with [OpenIntro.org](https://www.openintro.org/) to develop and enhance freely-available and open-source applied statistics content since 2015. Additionally, I am an OER Evangelist at Southern New Hampshire University.
+ I developed and maintain a course shell at [MyOpenMath](https://www.myopenmath.com/) which aligns with the OpenIntro Statistics (4Ed) textbook.
+ I developed and maintain a set of interactive notes for a course using the OpenIntro Statistics (4Ed) textbook and the R language. You can find those notebooks and installation instructions [here](https://github.com/agmath/AppliedStatsInteractive). Please let me know if you are using them!

#### Data Science Consulting

I have worked with [Reaching Higher New Hampshire](https://reachinghighernh.org/) as a data science consultant since 2018 on a variety of projects related to the state of public education in New Hampshire as well as education funding in New Hampshire.

#### North Shore Undergraduate Mathematics Conference

I am on the *Steering Committee* for the North Shore Undergraduate Mathematics Conference (link to be added), a regional conference dedicated to making mathematics accessible to any math undergraduates, with participants from throughout eastern Massachusetts and New Hampshire.
