<br/>
***Course Description:*** This course is an introduction to the methods used to analyze large datasets in biology. This course equips students with the mathematical and computing skills necessary to analyze large datasets. No prior experience in biology or computing is assumed. Students will be led and supported to design and implement algorithms for analyzing bioinformatic data in the R language. The datasets used in this class will be drawn from research conducted in the fields of biotechnology, health, and medicine. Students will design a group project that investigates a topic of their own interest and applies the skills they learn to a broader societal, environmental, or ethical issue.

Content covered in this course is relevant to exploring human and viral genomes, CRISPR, and genetic modification of organisms. Students will engage in technical analyses associated with these topics and will also be encouraged to consider the ethical implications of such work, weighing the benefits to society against the risks of interfering with the natural world.<br/>
