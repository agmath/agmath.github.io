title: Proof and Problem Solving
description: This is a homepage for MAT299, Proof and Problem Solving, with Dr. Gilbert at Southern New Hampshire University. This course introduces students to the practice of proof-writing in the context of integers and basic operations, divisibility, sets, relations, and functions. The focus of the course is on constructing and defending proofs. Students will also learn mathematical typesetting and LaTeX syntax using Google Colab and MathJax.

***Course Description:*** This course introduces students to the language and methods used to create and write mathematical proofs and solve problems. Methods of proof will include: direct, contrapositive, contradiction, and induction. Students will learn about and utilize the many functions of proof including: verification, explanation, communication, discovery, justification, and inquiry. The course will also explore the relationship between problem solving and the process of proving. Students will explore fundamental abstract concepts in mathematics including: functions and relations, set theory, number theory, and logic.<br/>
