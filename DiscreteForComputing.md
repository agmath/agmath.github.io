***Course Description:*** This course explores concepts in discrete mathematics with direct applications to computer programming. Topics from discrete math are relevant for flow control, memory allocation, searching and sorting, analysis of run-time, parallelization, queueing and online execution, and more. Topics may include logic, number representations, counting, functions, probability distributions, and arrays.<br/>
<br/>
*This language-agnostic course connects first year computer science students with the mathematics that underlays the foundations of computer programming. Students should expect to be exposed to mathematical concepts and immediately consider how they are relevant to programming and software development.*<br/>
