title: Statistical Learning and Classification
description: This is a homepage for MAT434, Statistical Learning and Classification, with Dr. Gilbert at Southern New Hampshire University. This course introduces students to the construction, assessment, and interpretation of models in the classification setting. Depending on student interest, applications in computer vision, natural language processing, and/or deep learning are also explored.

## MAT 434 - Statistical Learning and Classification

***Course Description:*** Using the foundational knowledge built in MAT 241 and MAT 300, we continue our study
of statistical models. This course moves beyond regression and into classification models, mixed models, and
unsupervised learning. Like MAT300, this course also emphasizes cross-validation as an important method for 
hyperparameter tuning, identifying appropriate levels of model flexibility, approximating future model 
performance, and analyzing the utility of a model. This course covers discriminant analysis, k nearest 
neighbors, tree-based methods (bagging, boosting, and random forests), support vector machines, and neural 
networks.<br/>

### Course Timeline and Notebooks

Below is a tentative timeline for our course. It includes preparatory work that should be done prior to each 
class meeting, a detailed set of notes corresponding to each class meeting, and assignments following each 
class meeting. The prepared notebooks use IDENTIFY DATASET TO USE and are provided so that you have a 
detailed account of each topic we discuss. We'll learn this content better by *doing* it than we will by 
simply *reading* and *running* pre-existing code, so we'll plan to utilize different data in class. For now, 
I'm planning to start with IDENTIFY SECONDARY DATASET that I hope you'll use to follow along during our 
in-class discussions.
